# HR software
A basic version


Here are the step-by-step actions to build the HR software for both the user interface (for employees/applicants) and the master interface (for HR personnel):

### 1. Planning and Requirement Gathering

1. **Identify Key Features and Requirements:**
   - Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders.
   - Define user roles (Applicants, HR personnel).
   - Outline core functionalities (e.g., registration, profile creation, application review).

2. **Create Use Cases and User Stories:**
   - Document user interactions.
   - Define workflows for both applicants and HR personnel.

### 2. Design

1. **Design Wireframes and Mockups:**
   - Create wireframes for each interface using tools like Sketch, Figma, or Adobe XD.
   - Design high-fidelity mockups based on wireframes.

2. **Design Database Schema:**
   - Identify entities (User, Application, Document, Interview).
   - Define relationships and structure using tools like ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram).

### 3. Development

#### Front-End Development

1. **Set Up Development Environment:**
   - Choose a front-end framework (React.js, Angular.js, or Vue.js).
   - Set up project structure and dependencies.

2. **Develop Components:**
   - **Login/Registration Page:**
     - Create forms for login and registration.
     - Implement validation and error handling.

   - **Dashboard:**
     - Design the layout for displaying user-specific information and notifications.

   - **Profile Page:**
     - Implement editable forms for personal and professional information.

   - **Application Form:**
     - Create multi-step forms for submitting applications.

   - **Document Upload:**
     - Integrate file upload functionality with preview and validation.

   - **Application Status:**
     - Develop a status tracker with timeline visualization.

   - **Notifications:**
     - Implement notification display and management.

#### Back-End Development

1. **Set Up Development Environment:**
   - Choose a back-end framework (Node.js with Express, Django, Ruby on Rails).
   - Set up project structure and dependencies.

2. **Develop APIs:**
   - **User Authentication:**
     - Implement registration, login, and JWT-based authentication.
   
   - **Profile Management:**
     - Create endpoints for updating personal and professional information.
   
   - **Application Submission:**
     - Develop APIs for submitting and managing applications.
   
   - **Document Upload:**
     - Implement file upload endpoints with storage integration (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).

   - **Status Tracking:**
     - Create endpoints for tracking and updating application status.

   - **HR Actions:**
     - Develop APIs for application review, document verification, and interview scheduling.

#### Integration

1. **Front-End and Back-End Integration:**
   - Connect front-end components with back-end APIs.
   - Ensure secure data transmission using HTTPS and token-based authentication.

2. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Define roles and permissions.
   - Restrict access to HR functionalities for non-HR users.

### 4. Testing

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for front-end components and back-end APIs using Jest, Mocha, or similar frameworks.

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test the interaction between front-end and back-end components.
   - Ensure seamless data flow and functionality.

3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
   - Conduct UAT sessions with stakeholders to validate requirements.
   - Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### 5. Deployment

1. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Configure continuous integration and deployment using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.

2. **Containerize Application:**
   - Use Docker to containerize front-end and back-end applications.

3. **Orchestrate Deployment:**
   - Deploy containers using Kubernetes or similar orchestration tools.

4. **Set Up Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Implement monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Set up logging with ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

### 6. Post-Deployment

1. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Continuously monitor application performance and server health.
   - Address any issues promptly.

2. **Gather User Feedback:**
   - Collect feedback from end-users to identify areas for improvement.

3. **Iterate and Improve:**
   - Release regular updates with new features and enhancements.
   - Fix bugs and optimize performance based on user feedback and monitoring data.

By following these steps, you can systematically develop and deploy a robust HR software solution that meets the needs of both applicants and HR personnel.
